			<body>Abstract: The analysis of our previous studies on the search for synthetic analgesics among N-R-<lb/>amides of bicyclic hetaryl-3-carboxylic acids has been performed; on its basis N-hetaryl(aryl)-alkyl-<lb/>4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides have been selected as new study objects. <lb/>The &quot;one pot synthesis&quot; of these compounds, which is simple to perform and at the same time highly <lb/>effective, has been offered. The method consists in the initial reaction of 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 , <lb/>1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid and N,N -carbonyldiimidazole in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide <lb/>with the subsequent amidation of imidazolide formed with hetarylalkyl-or benzylamines in the same <lb/>solvent. The peculiarities of 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra of the substances obtained, as well as their <lb/>electrospray ionization liquid chromato-mass spectra are discussed. According to the results of the <lb/>pharmacological tests carried out on the model of carrageenan inflammation it has been found that <lb/>all without exception N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides <lb/>demonstrate the statistically significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Among the substances <lb/>presented in this article analgesics and antiphlogistics, which increase the pain threshold and suppress the <lb/>inflammatory response more effectively than Lornoxicam and Diclofenac in the same doses, have been <lb/>identified. The molecular and crystal structures of a large group of the substances synthesized have <lb/>been studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. Comparison of these data with the results of biological <lb/>tests has revealed the fact of excellent correlation between the molecular conformations of N-hetaryl <lb/>(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides recorded in the crystal and the <lb/>potency of their analgesic effect. N-Thiophen-2-ylmethyl-and N-4-methoxybenzyl-amides of 4-methyl-2, <lb/>2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid has shown a high analgesic and anti-inflammatory <lb/>effect, therefore, they deserve more careful research. <lb/></body>

Introduction <lb/>For the first time, the analgesic properties of 4-hydroxy-2-quinolones were accidentally detected in <lb/>pharmacological tests of N-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-1-allyl-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-<lb/>quinoline-3-carboxamides hydrochlorides with the general formula I (Figure 1).

			<body>properties [4]. But the removal of the terminal pyridin-3-ylmethylaminocarbonyl group from the <lb/>bicyclic base by only one methylene link, i.e., transition from quinoline-carboxylic to quinoline-acetic <lb/>acids (amide V), is accompanied by an approximate two times decrease in activity [4]. <lb/>The high analgesic activity of N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-<lb/>quinoline-3-carboxamide (VI) detected during the primary pharmacological screening initially caused <lb/>an increased interest in it as a potentially new lead compound. However, very soon this substance <lb/>was found to have an increased propensity to form numerous polymorphic forms, and in most cases <lb/>they were low active forms [7]. Unfortunately, factors causing changes in the phase composition are <lb/>still unclear. Therefore, further study of amide VI as an analgesic is considered inappropriate, at least, <lb/>until the conditions, which would allow obtaining exceptionally high active crystalline modifications <lb/>of the substance in pharmacological respect, are found, and they will be able to guarantee their stability <lb/>during storage. <lb/>Transfer of the aminoalkylhetaryl fragment to position 4 of the quinolone nucleus is very <lb/>interesting as for pharmacology [8], but at the same time it creates pharmaceutical problems-acids <lb/>VII appeared to be insufficiently stable compounds and decarboxylated relatively easy (in solution <lb/>even at room temperature [9]). <lb/>Quinolonepropanenitriles VIII, products of their hydration (quinolonepropaneamides IX) and <lb/>hydrolysis (the corresponding quinolonepropanoic acids) are deprived of this drawback. Interest to <lb/>substances of this group is generated by their expressed analgesic properties [10], as well as by their <lb/>practically unlimited possibilities for further chemical transformations. <lb/>In general, N-(pyridinylmethyl)-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxamides <lb/>(X) are somewhat inferior in activity to quinoline analogs although highly active analgesics have been <lb/>identified among them [11]. <lb/>Summing up this short review two important, in our opinion, factors should be noted: the <lb/>presence of the hetarylalkylamide fragment in the molecule contributes to the manifestation of analgesic <lb/>properties, and rather great changes are permissible in the structure of the bicyclic hetaryl-3-carboxylic <lb/>acid. Hence, our next step in the search for new analgesics-N-hetarylalkyl-substituted amides <lb/>of 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid seems quite logical and natural, <lb/>and this message is devoted to these amides. The simultaneous involvement of the structurally close <lb/>N-benzyl-substituted analogs of these compounds in the circle of objects under study is also of interest, <lb/>i.e., the actual replacement of a heterocycle in the amide fragment by a phenyl or substituted phenyl <lb/>nucleus. The expediency and even the need for such an addition become more obvious and reasonable <lb/>if we take into account the high efficiency and productivity of the methodology of bioisosteric <lb/>replacements [6,12-17], which is well-proven when creating new biologically active substances. <lb/>2.

			<body>The study of the anti-inflammatory activity of N-hetarylalkylamides 2a-i brought new interesting <lb/>touches to the overall picture of our research. Pain and inflammation often accompany each other. <lb/>Therefore, drugs that can effectively eliminate both of these reactions at the same time are very popular <lb/>in modern medicine. N-Pyridinylmethylamides 2a-c has demonstrated the anti-inflammatory action <lb/>of low to moderate level (Table 2), and therefore, unlikely to have any further prospects. The only the <lb/>fact should be noted that meta-isomer 2b appeared to be the most active. <lb/>N-(Tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethyl)-amide 2f as an antiphlogistic agent (and indeed as an analgesic) <lb/>is also of a little interesting. The same can be said about hetarylpropylamides 2h and 2i although they <lb/>showed very good analgesic properties. Furan-2-ylmethylamides 2d and 2e by the strength of the <lb/>anti-inflammatory activity are comparable to Lornoxicam and Diclofenac, but significantly inferior <lb/>to them by the analgesic action. Of all the N-hetarylalkyl-substituted derivatives presented in this <lb/>work only N-thiophen-2-ylmethylamide 2g has shown a high analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity <lb/>simultaneously, therefore, it can be considered as a candidate for a more detailed study. <lb/>Replacement to N-benzyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides 3a-k really <lb/>appeared to be bioisosteric since the ability to suppress both pain and inflammation to some <lb/>extent was found in the vast majority of the test samples. In this case, the basic structure of this <lb/>series-unsubstituted N-benzylamide 3a-showed moderate biological effects. Halogenation of <lb/>the aromatic ring-amides 3b-d-was accompanied by almost complete loss of activity, therefore, <lb/>this modification should be considered extremely unsuccessful. Methylation of the benzyl fragment in <lb/>ortho-and para-position almost did not affect the anti-inflammatory properties, but the meta-methyl <lb/>substituent deactivated the molecule. At the same time, after the introduction of methyl groups the <lb/>analgesic action increased approximately twice compared to the base N-benzylamide 3a. However, <lb/>meta-isomer is an exception here-its analgesic activity remains at the initial level. <lb/>Methoxybenzylamides demonstrated the similar structural and biological regularities: a high <lb/>and statistically significant activity of ortho-and para-monosubstituted derivatives 3h and 3i in <lb/>the absence of the activity in the sample 3j with a meta-methoxy group. It is interesting that <lb/>the replacement of methoxy groups by a dioxole cycle annelated with the benzene nucleus and <lb/>formed on the basis of oxygen atoms in the same positions 3 and 4 (modification 3j → 3k) <lb/>was very useful. Thus, the anti-inflammatory properties of N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-amide <lb/>3k reach the maximum level among all compounds from the group of N-benzylamides 3a-k. <lb/>The analgesic effect also increases, though rather insignificantly. In general, according to the <lb/>results of our tests only two substances-N-thiophen-2-ylmethyl-and N-4-methoxybenzyl-amides <lb/>of 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid are of real interest for further <lb/>expanded physico-chemical and pharmacological study as potential analgesics with a powerful <lb/>anti-inflammatory effect. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.3. The Molecular and Crystal Structure Study <lb/>The facts observed and repeatedly confirmed experimentally that, at least, the analgesic activity <lb/>of N-R-amides of bicyclic hetaryl-3-carboxylic acids was mainly determined by their terminal amide <lb/>fragment served as a prerequisite for the study of the molecular and crystal structure of several <lb/>N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides presented in this <lb/>article. There are several reasons for the interest in such a study. First of all, it is, of course, scientific <lb/>curiosity and the desire to determine exactly how the general structure of the molecule (and therefore, <lb/>the activity) changes during the transition from one N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-amide 2 or 3 to another. <lb/>The next important point is the introduction of test samples in the form of an aqueous suspension, <lb/>which provides their entry into the body of the experimental animal in the initial crystalline state. <lb/>And finally, the last argument in favor of our research is that in pharmaceutical and medical chemistry <lb/>it is well known that the molecular and crystal structure of organic compounds has a significant impact <lb/>on their pharmacological properties, and therefore, often becomes the object of close attention of <lb/>researchers [34-39]. <lb/>As the objects of X-ray diffraction studies we deliberately chose several N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-<lb/>amides 2 and 3, which showed the possibility of different levels of pharmacological properties and <lb/>had mono-crystals that were suitable for such analysis. Thus, in the case of one of the most biologically <lb/>active compounds-N-thiophen-2-ylmethylamide 2g-it was found that its thiazine heterocycle was <lb/>in the conformation of the distorted sofa with puckering parameters [40] S = 0.61, Θ = 55.8 • , Ψ = 14.0 • <lb/>(Figure 2). The deviations of the S (1) and C (8) atoms from the mean plane of the remaining atoms of this <lb/>cycle were 0.81 Å and 0.19 Å, respectively. The N (1) atom had pyramidal configuration with very small <lb/>extent of pyramidality (the sum of the bond angles centered at it was 357 • ). Some repulsion between <lb/>the methyl group and the substituent at the C (8) atom (the shortened intramolecular contact H (15b) . . . <lb/>C (9) is 2.51 Å compared to the van der Waals radii sum [41] 2.87 Å) caused the rotation of the substituent <lb/>relatively the thiazine cycle (the C (7) -C (8) -C (9) -O (1) torsion angle was 67.5(2) • ) and elongation of <lb/>the C (7) -C (8) and C (8) -C (9) bonds (1.349(2) Å and 1.498(2) Å) compared to their mean values [42] <lb/>1.326 Å and 1.455 Å, respectively. In addition the repulsion between the methyl group and benzene <lb/>ring was observed (the shortened intramolecular contacts were: H (15a) . . . C (5) 2.83 Å, H (5) . . . C (15) <lb/>2.60 Å). The thiophene cycle was located in orthogonal position to the carbamide fragment (the <lb/>C (9) -N (2) -C (10) -C (11) torsion angle was -94.2(2) • ) and was disordered over two positions (A and B) <lb/>with equal populations due to rotation around the C (10) -C (11) bond (the N (2) -C (10) -C (11) -S (2) torsion <lb/>angle was 77.8(2) • in conformer A and -94.2(2) • in conformer B). <lb/></body>

			<body>Analysis of X-ray diffraction data shows that the spatial structure of the benzothiazine-3-carbamide <lb/>fragment in all samples studied remains virtually unchanged. However, the location of N-hetaryl(aryl) <lb/>methyl substituents in the crystals changes significantly. In particular, in the range of N-thiophen-2-<lb/>ylmethylamide 2g → N-2-methylbenzylamide 3e → N-5-methylfuran-2-ylmethyl-amide 2e → N-3-methyl-<lb/>benzylamide 3f → N-benzylamide 3a → N-furan-2-ylmethylamide 2d → N-pyridin-4-ylmethylamide <lb/>2c → N-2-chlorobenzylamide 3c → N-4-chlorobenzylamide 3d their gradual turn in the direction of the <lb/>plane of the benzothiazine bicycle is observed. It is interesting that in the same sequence and gradually <lb/>the analgesic activity of these compounds decreases (Figure 5). Therefore, our study clearly shows <lb/>that the strength of the analgesic effect (but not the anti-inflammatory one) of N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-<lb/>methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides determines the spatial location of their terminal <lb/>amide fragments. Thus, the high activity of N-thiophen-2-ylmethylamide 2g is presumably provided <lb/>by conformer 2g-B, which feature is an almost right angle between the planes of the thiophene and <lb/>benzothiazine cycles (Table 3). Conformer 2g-A (shown in Figure 5) is structurally very similar and differs <lb/>only in approximately 180 • turn of the thiophene nucleus around the 3-CONHCH 2 -Ht bond. It is difficult <lb/>to answer unambiguously how this change in the structure affects the manifestations of the analgesic <lb/>action. But, judging by the position of the oxygen atom in the bioisosteric furan cycle of highly active <lb/>N-5-methylfuran-2-ylmethylamide 2e and low active N-furan-2-ylmethylamide 2d (Figure 5, Table 3) the <lb/>preference should be given to conformer 2g-B. However, the presence of conformer 2g-A in the crystal <lb/>is also not critical since, in general, N-thiophen-2-ylmethylamide 2g remains one of the most powerful <lb/>analgesics (unlike N-4-chlorobenzyl derivative 3d, in which one of the conformers completely deactivates <lb/>the sample). <lb/>Sci.

However, the presence of conformer 2g-A in <lb/>the crystal is also not critical since, in general, N-thiophen-2-ylmethylamide 2g remains one of the <lb/>most powerful analgesics (unlike N-4-chlorobenzyl derivative 3d, in which one of the conformers <lb/>completely deactivates the sample). <lb/>2g <lb/>3e-A <lb/>3e-B <lb/>2e <lb/>3f <lb/>3a <lb/>2d <lb/>2c <lb/>3c <lb/>3d-A <lb/>3d-B <lb/>Relative anti-inflammatory <lb/>activity <lb/>Relative analgesic activity <lb/>Conformer A <lb/>highly active <lb/>analgesic <lb/>Conformer B <lb/>low active <lb/>analgesic <lb/>Figure 5.

Highly, moderately and low <lb/>active analgesics may well turn out to be both powerful antiphlogistics and completely inactive <lb/>substances regardless of the spatial structure (see, for example N-thiophen-2-ylmethylamide 2g, <lb/>N-3-methyl-benzylamide 3f and N-furan-2-ylmethylamide 2d, respectively).

			<body>Most likely, the regularities found by us are valid only for N-R-amides of the benzyl type, and are <lb/>unlikely to manifest themselves in the case of hetaryl-, aryl-, phenethyl-or alkylamides. However, <lb/>even such a limited range of objects allows us to speak about preservation of those conformations <lb/>of N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides 2 and 3 in the <lb/>solution, they were formed during formation of their crystals. Here, perhaps, it would be appropriate <lb/>to mention one of the most controversial and yet unsolved problems of crystal chemistry, which has a <lb/>direct relationship to the question under consideration: whether any differences between different <lb/>polymorphic forms of the same substance remain after their transfer from the crystalline state to the <lb/>solution [46,47]. The often biased and skeptical attitude towards this issue that prevails in the scientific <lb/>community is well known. But the numerous experimental facts accumulated so far clearly indicate <lb/>that polymorphic forms of organic substances in the solution can still retain a number of individual <lb/>properties, including the original conformation [47]. It is clear that such conformational stability cannot <lb/>last indefinitely. However, those few hours, during which the crystalline (or just dissolved) substance <lb/>introduced into the body enters the biological fluids, and then into the target organ and has its specific <lb/>effect, is obviously a rather real term. <lb/>Finally, another important point should be mentioned. All compounds considered in this section <lb/>crystallize in centrosymmetric space groups, it indicates the existence of their symmetric equivalents <lb/>in crystals with a mirror-opposite conformation due to the presence of a plane of symmetry. In other <lb/>words, the crystals of N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides <lb/>2 and 3 studied contain not one or two conformers, but two or four, respectively-those indicated in <lb/>Figure 5 and Table 3 and their mirror reflections. Therefore, it is impossible to state unambiguously <lb/>that the high analgesic activity, for example, of N-5-methylfuran-2-ylmethylamide 2e, is provided <lb/>by the conformer depicted in Figure 5, but not by its symmetric equivalent. An accurate answer <lb/>to these questions can be given only in some rare cases when it is possible to separate such <lb/>conformers and subject them to comparative pharmacological tests. The first study of this type <lb/>was N-benzyl-4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide obtained in the <lb/>form of two pseudo-enantiomeric polymorphic forms (see Figure 5), of which only one showed <lb/>the high analgesic activity [48]. This example is interesting because it allowed experimentally <lb/>to give a quantitative assessment of the effect on the biological properties of the molecule <lb/>conformation. In contrast to the classical polymorphs, here significant differences in the activity <lb/>of pseudo-enantiomeric conformer A and B can not be explained by different solubility since all the <lb/>parameters of their molecular and crystal structure (bond lengths, valence angles, packaging, habit, <lb/>etc.) are absolutely the same. Only torsion angles determining the conformational individuality differ, <lb/>and even then not by absolute values, but only by signs (+or -). <lb/>4. Conclusions <lb/>This work describes the preparative method for obtaining new N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-<lb/>dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides, which are of interest as potential analgesic and <lb/>anti-inflammatory agents. The structure of all compounds synthesized has been confirmed by the data <lb/>of elemental analysis, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization liquid chromato-mass <lb/>spectrometry. The pharmacological screening has revealed highly active substances with the analgesic <lb/>and anti-inflammatory actions that are not inferior and even superior to Lornoxicam and Diclofenac <lb/>among N-hetaryl(aryl)alkyl-4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 ,1-benzothiazine-3-carboxamides. Based on <lb/>a detailed analysis of the molecular and crystal structure of a large group of substances and <lb/>comparison of the X-ray diffraction data obtained with the results of biological tests the molecular <lb/>conformation has been recognized to be the main criterion of the analgesic activity of the compounds <lb/>under study. N-Thiophen-2-ylmethyl-and N-4-methoxybenzyl-amides of 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2λ 6 , <lb/>1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid are recommended for the in-depth pharmacological study as an <lb/>agent of the complex analgesic and anti-inflammatory action. <lb/></body>
